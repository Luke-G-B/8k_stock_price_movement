Other Events       This Current Report on Form 8-K updates 3M’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2016 (“3M’s 2016 Annual Report”) to reflect the following:       Effective in the first quarter of 2017 as part of 3M’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers the Company made the following changes:       Integration of former Renewable Energy Division     ·    3M’s former Renewable Energy Division (RED) has been integrated into existing divisions within the Electronics and Energy business segment and Safety and Graphics business segment. 3M is committed to leadership in sustainability and to enabling the advancement of energy solutions into the future. Integrating RED’s offerings into larger divisions already serving these segments will provide increased scale and build on strength by leveraging 3M’s existing brands go-to-market capabilities and relationships to support growth objectives.      Creation of Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division     ·    3M created the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division which combines the former Automotive Division and Aerospace and Commercial Transportation Division which were both within the Industrial business segment. Combining the strengths along with the deep industry knowledge of each business will enable this new division to utilize shared technology platforms and processes to deliver a broader set of innovative solutions along with world-class quality and service to 3M’s customers. This combination will help accelerate the Company’s profitable growth and market relevance across the automotive aerospace and commercial transportation industries.      Consolidation of U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting     ·    The Company consolidated its customer account activity in the U.S. into more centralized sales districts. This improved alignment reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple businesses within 3M creating a better customer experience. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in the U.S. The alignment of U.S. customer accounts to fewer more focused sales districts changed the attribution of dual credit across 3M’s business segments.       The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding changes involving business segments and dual credit reporting as well as the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Payments and ASU No. 2016-18 Restricted Cash. Since the effects of these ASU’s were immaterial to all periods presented no impact was reflected in the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition presented.       The preceding information is filed hereunder as Exhibit 99 which is incorporated herein by reference.       Item 9.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K updates the information contained in 3M’s 2016 Annual Report to reflect the changes described above which were effective during the first quarter of 2017. Updates provided in this Form 8-K are contained in Part 1 Item 1 “Business” and Part II Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” (specifically Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Note 3 Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Note 16 Business Segments). 3M also updated Part II Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” to reflect the impact of the business segment and dual credit reporting changes. Information for all periods presented herein reflects the impact of these business segment and dual credit reporting changes.       By virtue of this Current Report the Company will be able to incorporate the updated information by reference into future registration statements or post-effective amendments to existing registration statements. This Current Report does not update for other changes since the filing of the 2016 Annual Report (e.g. new developments in commitments and contingencies). For significant developments since the filing of the 2016 Annual Report refer to subsequent 2017 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.   Forward-Looking Statements   This Current Report contains forward-looking information about 3M’s financial results and estimates and business prospects that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

Other Events.   Michael F. Roman Executive Vice President Industrial Business Group adopted a prearranged trading plan on November 16 2016 in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and 3M Companys policies regarding transactions in 3M securities by insiders.   Rule 10b5-1 plans permit insiders to sell a specified portion of their holdings at a specified time or over a specified period of time pursuant to a written plan established at a time when the insider is not in possession of material non-public information.  A Rule 10b5-1 plan offers an opportunity for an insider to provide for future transactions to occur without concern about unforeseen future events that may be considered material non-public information at the time those transactions occur.  A Rule 10b5-1 plan may for example allow an insider to diversify his or her investment portfolio by selling Company shares from time to time over a pre-established period of time without regard for future developments relating to the Company.  By spreading the sales out over an extended period of time the insider may minimize the effect of the sales on the market for the Companys stock.   Mr. Romans plan contemplates the exercise of an employee stock option for up to 4036 shares of 3M common stock and the prompt sale thereof but only if the stock meets the minimum price thresholds specified in the plan.  The plan provides that the exercise and sale may occur through May 1 2017 on which date the plan will expire if the transactions have not been executed.  Mr. Roman is and assuming execution of the transactions contemplated by the plan would remain above the minimum stock ownership thresholds established by the Company for its executive officers.  Any transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly on Form 4 and if applicable in a Form 144 in each case as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The change between business segments was as follows:     ·    Elements of the electronic bonding product lines were previously separately reflected in the Electronics Materials Solutions Division (Electronics and Energy business segment) and the Industrial Adhesives and Tapes Division (Industrial business segment). Effective in the first quarter of 2016 certain sales and operating income results for these electronic bonding product lines in aggregate were equally divided between the Electronics and Energy business segment and Industrial business segment. This change resulted in a decrease in net sales and operating income for total year 2015 of $33 million and $7 million respectively in the Industrial business segment offset by a corresponding increase in the Electronics and Energy business segment.      The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding reporting change involving business segments for all periods presented.       The preceding information is filed hereunder as Exhibit 99 which is incorporated herein by reference.       Item 9.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K updates the information contained in 3M’s 2015 Annual Report to reflect 3M’s product line reporting change involving two of its business segments which was effective during the first quarter of 2016. Updates provided in this Form 8-K are contained in Part I Item 1 “Business” and Part II Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” (specifically Note 3 Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Note 16 Business Segments). 3M also updated Part II Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” to reflect the impact of the business segment product line change. Information for all periods presented herein reflects the impact of this product line change.        By virtue of this Current Report the Company will be able to incorporate the updated information by reference into future registration statements or post-effective amendments to existing registration statements. This Current Report does not update for other changes since the filing of the 2015 Annual Report (e.g. new developments in commitments and contingencies). For significant developments since the filing of the 2015 Annual Report refer to subsequent 2016 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units performance bonus awards performance shares and other stock- or cash-based awards.   Authorized Shares. The 2016 Plan authorizes the issuance of the sum of: (a) 23965000 shares of common stock; plus (b) the aggregate number of shares of common stock that remain available for future awards under the Companys existing equity plans as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan; plus (c) for each award that is outstanding under the Companys existing equity plans as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan (i) one share for each share subject to an award that is an option or stock appreciation right and (ii) 2.5 shares for each share subject to an award other than an option or stock appreciation right (or other award subject to an exercise price strike price or similar concept) (a  Full Value Award ) in each case that subsequently becomes available for issuance under the 2016 Plan pursuant to the share counting provisions of the 2016 Plan. The aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan will be reduced by 2.5 shares for each share delivered in settlement of any Full Value Award and by one share for each share delivered in settlement of any option or stock appreciation right. Shares issued under the 2016 Plan may be authorized but unissued shares shares purchased on the open market or treasury shares. In no event will more than 34000000 shares of common stock be issuable pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options under the 2016 Plan during its ten-year term.   Administration. The 2016 Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the  Board ) or a subcommittee thereof (or by the Board or another Board committee as may be determined by the Board from time to time). The administrator of the 2016 Plan (the  Administrator ) or its delegate will have the authority to determine which service providers receive awards and set the terms and conditions applicable to the award within the confines of the 2016 Plans terms. The Administrator or its delegate will have the authority to make all determinations and interpretations under prescribe all forms for use with and adopt rules for the administration of the 2016 Plan.   Award Limits for Employees. The 2016 Plan includes annual limits on awards that may be granted to any individual participant.

The maximum aggregate amount that may become payable (in cash shares of common stock or any combination thereof) pursuant to all performance bonus awards that may be paid to any one person during any calendar year is $10000000. These numbers will be multiplied by two with respect to awards granted to a participant during the calendar year in which the participant commences employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing in no event will more than the authorized number of shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan be granted to any one person during any calendar year with respect to one or more awards denominated in shares. For purposes of these individual award limits each share subject to an award (including a Full Value Award) will be counted as one share against the specified limit.   Compensation Limit for Non-Employee Directors. The sum of all cash or other compensation and the value (determined as of the grant date in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 (or any successor thereto)) of all awards granted to a non-employee director under the 2016 Plan during any calendar year for services as a member of the Board may not exceed $600000.   2        Other Terms. The 2016 Plan also contains provisions with respect to payment of exercise or purchase prices vesting and expiration of awards adjustments and treatment of awards upon certain corporate transactions including stock splits recapitalizations and mergers transferability of awards and tax withholding requirements.   Amendment and Termination.  The Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board may amend suspend or terminate the 2016 Plan at any time and from time to time. However no amendment requiring stockholder approval to comply with applicable laws will be effective unless approved by the Board and the Companys stockholders and no amendment other than an amendment that increases the number of shares available under the 2016 Plan may materially and adversely affect the economic benefits to be delivered under an outstanding award as of the date of such amendment without the consent of the affected participant.   Effective Date and Term.  The 2016 Plan became effective immediately upon receipt of stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting.  Unless sooner terminated by the Board the 2016 Plan will expire on May 10 2026.   The terms and conditions of the 2016 Plan are described in the section entitled  Proposal No. 4:  Approval of the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan  in the Companys Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23 2016. The Companys directors and executive officers are eligible to participate in the 2016 Plan. The foregoing description of the 2016 Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual plan document which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition       As described in this Current Report during the first quarter of 2016 3M made a product line reporting change involving two of its business segments. Elements of the electronic bonding product lines were previously separately reflected in the Electronics and Energy business segment and the Industrial business segment. Effective the first quarter of 2016 certain sales and operating income results for these product lines in aggregate were equally divided between these two business segments. This change resulted in a decrease in net sales for total year 2015 of $33 million in the Industrial business segment offset by a corresponding increase in the Electronics and Energy business segment. This Current Report includes supplemental unaudited historical information relative to business segment sales and operating income on both an annual and quarterly basis for the years ended December 31 2015 2014 and 2013 (furnished hereunder as Exhibit 99 and incorporated herein by reference). The Company did not operate under this structure for any of these prior periods and will begin to report comparative results under the new structure with the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31 2016.       The information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed to be “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section nor shall it be incorporated by reference into a filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.

The Credit Agreement amended and restated the $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit agreement dated as of August 5 2014 among 3M the lenders named therein and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. as administrative agent.   Under the Credit Agreement 3M pays a facility fee that varies between 0.040% and 0.100% depending on our credit rating.  Revolving advances denominated in U.S. Dollars carry at 3Ms option either the  base rate  of interest in effect plus the applicable margin or the  eurocurrency rate  which is a periodic fixed LIBOR plus the applicable margin.  Borrowings denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars carry the  eurocurrency rate.  The  base rate  of interest is the highest of (i) JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.s prime rate (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% (if one-month LIBOR is less than zero such rate shall be deemed to be zero).  The applicable margin includes a market rate spread which is a rate per annum equal to the credit default swap mid-rate spread of 3M for the applicable tenor.  This spread varies between 0.100% and 1.125% depending on our credit rating.  The applicable margin for  eurocurrency rate  advances is the market rate spread.  The applicable margin for  base rate  advances is the market rate spread minus 1.00% (but not less than 0%).   The Credit Agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of the total facility up to $5.0 billion with the grant of such request at the lenders discretion.  The Credit Agreement contains customary representations warranties and covenants including but not limited to covenants restricting our ability to incur liens merge or consolidate with another entity where 3M is not the surviving entity. Further the Credit Agreement contains a covenant requiring us to maintain our EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to interest payable on all funded debt for the same period.   The full terms and conditions of the credit facility are set forth in the Credit Agreement. A copy of the Credit Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.   Some of the lenders named under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with 3M and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services including cash management investment banking foreign exchange and trust services.

Bauman Executive Vice President adopted a prearranged trading plan on November 6 2015 in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and 3M Companys policies with respect to insider sales.   Rule 10b5-1 plans permit insiders to sell a specified portion of their holdings at a specified time or over a specified period of time pursuant to a plan established at a time when the insider is not in possession of material non-public information.  A Rule 10b5-1 plan offers an opportunity for an insider to provide for future transactions to occur without concern about unforeseen future events that may be considered material non-public information at the time those transactions occur.  A Rule 10b5-1 plan may for example allow an insider to diversify his or her investment portfolio by selling Company shares from time to time over a pre-established period of time without regard for future developments relating to the Company.  By spreading the sales out over an extended period of time the insider may minimize the effect of the sales on the market for the Companys stock.   Mr. Baumans plan contemplates the exercise of an employee stock option for up to 5392 shares of 3M common stock and the prompt sale thereof but only if the stock meets the minimum price thresholds as specified in the plan.  The plan is through May 9 2016. Assuming all transactions execute Mr. Bauman would remain above the minimum stock ownership thresholds established by the Company.  Any transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and if applicable Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Credit Agreement amended and restated the $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit agreement dated as of September 28 2012 among 3M the lenders named therein and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. as administrative agent.   Under the Credit Agreement 3M pays a facility fee that varies between 0.040% and 0.100% depending on our credit rating.  Revolving advances denominated in U.S. Dollars carry at 3Ms option either the  base rate  of interest in effect plus the applicable margin or the  eurocurrency rate  which is a periodic fixed LIBOR plus the applicable margin.  Borrowings denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars carry the  eurocurrency rate.  The  base rate  of interest is the highest of (i) JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.s prime rate (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%.  The applicable margin includes a market rate spread which is a rate per annum equal to the credit default swap mid-rate spread of 3M for the applicable tenor.  This spread varies between 0.100% and 1.125% depending on our credit rating.  The applicable margin for  eurocurrency rate  advances is the market rate spread.  The applicable margin for  base rate  advances is the market rate spread minus 1.00% (but not less than 0%).   The Credit Agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of the total facility up to $4.5 billion with the grant of such request at the lenders discretion.  The Credit Agreement contains customary representations warranties and covenants including but not limited to covenants restricting our ability to incur liens merge or consolidate with another entity. Further the Credit Agreement contains a covenant requiring us to maintain our EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to interest payable on all funded debt for the same period.   The full terms and conditions of the credit facility are set forth in the Credit Agreement. A copy of the Credit Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.   Some of the lenders named under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with 3M and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services including cash management investment banking foreign exchange and trust services.

The product move between business segments was as follows:    ·   The movement of the Fire Protection product line from the Building and Commercial Services Division (Safety and Graphics business segment) to the Industrial Adhesives and Tapes Division (Industrial business segment). This product move resulted in an increase in net sales for total year 2013 of $73 million in the Industrial business segment offset by a corresponding decrease in the Safety and Graphics business segment.   In addition other changes within business segments were as follows:   ·   The combination of certain existing divisions/departments into new divisions. Within the Electronics and Energy business segment the new divisions include the Electrical Markets Division (which now includes the former Infrastructure Protection Division) and the Electronic Solutions Division (which now includes the former 3M Touch Systems Inc.). Within the Safety and Graphics business segment the new Commercial Solutions Division was created from the combination of the former Architectural Markets Department the former Building and Commercial Services Division and the former Commercial Graphics Division.  None of these combinations crossed business segments. ·   The renaming of the former Aerospace and Aircraft Maintenance Division within the Industrial business segment to the Aerospace and Commercial Transportation Division. ·   The movement of certain product lines between various divisions within the same business segment.   The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding product move between business segments for all periods presented.   The preceding information is filed hereunder as Exhibit 99 which is incorporated herein by reference.   Item 9.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K updates the information contained in 3Ms 2013 Annual Report to reflect 3Ms realignment of its business segments which were effective during the first quarter of 2014. Updates provided in this Form 8-K are contained in Part I Item 1  Business  and Part II Item 8  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  (specifically Note 3 Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Note 15 Business Segments). 3M also updated Part II Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  to reflect the impact of the business segment realignments. Information for all periods presented herein reflects the impact of these realignments.   By virtue of this Current Report the Company will be able to incorporate the updated information by reference into future registration statements or post-effective amendments to existing registration statements. This Current Report does not update for other changes since the filing of the 2013 Annual Report (e.g. new developments in commitments and contingencies). For significant developments since the filing of the 2013 Annual Report refer to subsequent 2014 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.   2        ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS      Exhibit No.       Description                   12       Calculation of Ratio of Earnings to Fixed   Charges     23       Consent of Independent Registered Public   Accounting Firm     99       Updates where applicable to 3Ms 2013   Annual Report on Form 10-K include:             Part I Item   1 Business             Part I Item   1A Risk Factors             Part II Item   7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of   Operations             Part II Item   7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk             Part II Item   8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data     101       The following   financial information from 3M Companys Current Report on Form 8-K for   the year ended December 31 2013 filed with the SEC on May 15   2014 formatted in Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL):   (i) the Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended December 31   2013 2012 and 2011 (ii) the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive   Income for the years ended December 31 2013 2012 and 2011   (iii) the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31 2013 and   2012 (iv) the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the years   ended December 31 2013 2012 and 2011 (v) the Consolidated   Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31 2013 2012 and   2011 and (vi) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.      3        SIGNATURES   Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.          3M COMPANY             (Registrant)                       Date: May 15 2014                               By    /s/ David W.

Thulin Chairman of the Board President and CEO adopted a prearranged trading plan on November 14 2013 in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and 3M Companys policies with respect to insider sales.   Rule 10b5-1 plans permit insiders to sell a specified portion of their holdings at a specified time or over a specified period of time pursuant to a plan established at a time when the insider is not in possession of material non-public information.  A Rule 10b5-1 plan offers an opportunity for an insider to provide for future transactions to occur without concern about unforeseen future events that may be considered material non-public information.  A Rule 10b5-1 plan may for example allow an insider to provide for the exercise of an employee stock option on a specified date in the future and the sale of the underlying stock to avoid having the option expire or to assure that the insider will not be prevented from selling the shares in the open market in order to obtain the funds needed to pay the option exercise price.   Mr.Thulins plan contemplates the exercise of an employee stock option for up to 43677 shares of 3M common stock on May 6 2014 and the prompt sale of those as specified in the plan.  After completion of the contemplated transactions Mr. Thulin would remain above the minimum stock ownership thresholds established by the Company.  Any transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and if applicable Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

A Rule 10b5-1 plan may for example allow an insider to diversify his or her investment portfolio by selling Company shares from time to time over a pre-established period of time without regard for future developments relating to the Company.  By spreading the sales out over an extended period of time the insider may minimize the effect of the sales on the market for the Companys stock.   Mr.Shins plan contemplates the sale of net shares out of a maximum of 2720 shares of 3M common stock (acquired through Restricted Stock Units vesting) but only if the stock meets a minimum price threshold as specified in the plan.  The plan is through January 2 2015.  Assuming all transactions execute Mr. Shin would remain above the minimum stock ownership thresholds established by the Company.  Any transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and if applicable Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Effective in the first quarter of 2013 3M completed a realignment of its business groups (segments) to better serve global markets and customers. This realignment included:   ·                  The alignment of divisions into five business groups (segments) as further described below. ·                  The combination of certain existing divisions into new divisions. These included Traffic Safety and Security Division (reflecting the combination of the former Traffic Safety Systems Division and Security Systems Division) and the Optical Systems Division (reflecting the combination of the former Optical Systems Division and Mobile Interactive Solutions Division). ·                  The movement of certain product lines between various divisions within and across certain business segments.   In addition to the above there were also changes to dual credit amounts as a result of the realigned structure. The new structure is comprised of five business segments: Industrial Safety and Graphics Electronics and Energy Health Care and Consumer.   Industrial: This business segment previously referred to as Industrial and Transportation is largely unchanged except for the transfer of the Renewable Energy Division to the Electronics and Energy business segment.   Safety and Graphics: This business segment includes Architectural Markets Building and Commercial Services Commercial Graphics Industrial Mineral Products Personal Safety and Traffic Safety and Security. This new business segment also reflects movement of certain product lines between various divisions.   Electronics and Energy: This business segment includes Communication Markets Electrical Markets Electronics Markets Materials Electronic Solutions Infrastructure Protection Optical Systems Renewable Energy and 3M Touch Systems. This new business segment also reflects the movement of certain product lines between various divisions.   Health Care: This business segment is largely unchanged except for the movement of certain product lines between various divisions.   Consumer: This business segment previously referred to as Consumer and Office is largely unchanged except for the movement of certain product lines between various divisions.   Geographic area information is used by the Company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. Export sales and certain income and expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. During the first quarter of 2013 3M realigned its geographic area reporting to include Puerto Rico in the United States rather than in the Latin America/Canada region.   Item 9.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K updates the information contained in 3Ms 2012 Annual Report to reflect 3Ms realignment of its business segments and geographic areas which were effective during the first quarter of 2013. Updates provided in this Form 8-K are contained in Part I Item 1  Business  and Part II Item 8  Financial Statements and   2        Supplementary Data  (specifically Note 3 Goodwill and Intangible Assets Note 15 Business Segments and Note 16 Geographic Areas). 3M also updated Part II Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  to reflect the impact of the business segment and geographic area realignments. Information for all periods presented herein reflects the impact of these realignments. In addition Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) Note 5 (Supplemental Equity and Comprehensive Information) and Note 11 (Derivatives) have been updated to retrospectively apply the presentation and disclosure requirements of certain accounting standards which became effective January 1 2013.   By virtue of this Current Report the Company will be able to incorporate the updated information by reference into future registration statements or post-effective amendments to existing registration statements. This Current Report does not update for other changes since the filing of the 2012 Annual Report (e.g. new developments in commitments and contingencies). For significant developments since the filing of the 2012 Annual Report refer to subsequent 2013 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

Morgan Securities LLC and Citicorp Global Markets Inc. as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. as administrative agent Citibank N.A. as syndication agent Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. as documentation agent and a syndicate of lenders as defined in the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement amended and restated the $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit agreement dated as of August 5 2011 among 3M the lenders named therein and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. as administrative agent.   Under the Credit Agreement 3M pays a facility fee that varies between 0.045% and 0.100% depending on our credit rating. Revolving advances denominated in U.S. Dollars carry at 3Ms option either the  base rate  of interest in effect plus the applicable margin or the  eurocurrency rate  which is a periodic fixed LIBOR plus the applicable margin.  Borrowings denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars carry the  eurocurrency rate.  The  base rate  of interest is the highest of (i) JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.s prime rate (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%.  The applicable margin includes a market rate spread which is a rate per annum equal to the credit default swap mid-rate spread of 3M for the applicable tenor.  This spread varies between 0.100% and 1.125% depending on our credit rating.  The applicable margin for  eurocurrency rate  advances is the market rate spread.  The applicable margin for  base rate  advances is the market rate spread minus 1.00% (but not less than 0%).   The Credit Agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of the total facility up to $2 billion with the grant of such request at the lenders discretion.  The Credit Agreement contains customary representations warranties and covenants including but not limited to covenants restricting our ability to incur liens merge or consolidate with another entity. Further the Credit Agreement contains a covenant requiring us to maintain our EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to interest payable on all funded debt for the same period.   The full terms and conditions of the credit facility are set forth in the Credit Agreement. A copy of the Credit Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.   Some of the lenders named under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with 3M and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services including cash management investment banking foreign exchange and trust services.

Other Events.     Brad T. Sauer  Executive Vice President has adopted a prearranged trading plan effective May 8 2012 in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and 3M Companys policies with respect to insider sales.   Rule 10b5-1 plans permit insiders to sell fixed portions of their holdings over a designated period of time by establishing the prearranged written plans at a time when they are not in possession of material non-public information.  Such programs provide for regular selling of a predetermined fixed number of company shares in order to gradually diversify the individuals investment portfolio minimize the market effect of share sales by spreading them out over an extended period of time and avoid concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material non-public information.   Mr. Sauers plan contemplates the sale of up to a maximum of 22193 shares of 3M common stock (acquired through stock option exercises) through December 28 2012 but only if the stock meets the minimum price thresholds as specified in the plan.  Assuming all transactions execute Mr. Sauer would remain above the minimum stock ownership thresholds established by the Company.  Any transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and if applicable Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In February 2012 the Compensation Committee recommended and the Board of Directors approved subject to stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting an amendment to the 2008 Plan that would make the following changes:   ·                  Increase the number of shares of 3M common stock authorized for issuance or delivery pursuant to awards granted under the 2008 Plan by an additional 36000000 shares; and   ·                  Revise the rate at which full value awards (primarily performance shares restricted stock and restricted stock units) are counted for purposes of the 2008 Plans authorized share limit.   2        The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual plan document which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference.

An abstention will however be counted as entitled to vote on a proposal and will therefore have the effect of a vote  AGAINST.

Palensky Executive Vice President has adopted a prearranged trading plan effective May 3 2012 in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and 3M Companys policies with respect to insider sales.   Rule 10b5-1 plans permit insiders to sell fixed portions of their holdings over a designated period of time by establishing the prearranged written plans at a time when they are not in possession of material non-public information.  Such programs provide for regular selling of a predetermined fixed number of company shares in order to gradually diversify the individuals investment portfolio minimize the market effect of share sales by spreading them out over an extended period of time and avoid concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material non-public information.   Mr. Palenskys plan contemplates (A) the sale of up to a maximum of 59452 shares of 3M common stock (acquired through stock option exercises) through October 28 2012 and (B) the exercise of up to a maximum of 32952 shares in a cashless-sell-to-cover method (selling enough shares to cover option share purchase price fee and taxes then retaining the remaining shares) through October 25 2012 while in both cases only if the stock meets the minimum price thresholds as specified in the plan.  Assuming all transactions execute Mr. Palensky would remain above the minimum stock ownership thresholds established by the Company.  Any transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and if applicable Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others net earnings from continuing operations excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as expenses primarily associated with acquisitions and restructuring actions charges related to cost reduction initiatives the recognition of a gain and deferred taxes associated with the sale of the Medical Optics business an adjustment to the equity investment in Mylan Venezuela devaluation losses and tax benefits due to the resolution of various tax positions from prior years. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results.  In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others net earnings from continuing operations excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as expenses primarily associated with acquisitions restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives a gain on the sale of the Medical Optics business foreign exchange loss related to Venezuela and resolution of various tax positions from prior years. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.   On April 13 2017 Alere Inc. a Delaware corporation ( Alere ) Abbott Laboratories an Illinois corporation ( Abbott ) and Angel Sub Inc. a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott ( Merger Sub ) entered into an Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Amendment ) which amends the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Original Merger Agreement  and as amended by the Amendment the  Amended Merger Agreement ) by and among Alere Abbott and Merger Sub.   Under the terms of the Amendment Alere Abbott and Merger Sub have agreed to reduce the merger consideration to be paid by Abbott for each share of Aleres common stock par value $0.001 per share (the  Shares ) in the Merger (as defined in the Amended Merger Agreement) to $51.00 in cash per Share without interest from $56.00 in cash per Share without interest.   The Amendment also extends the date after which each of Alere and Abbott would have a right to terminate the Amended Merger Agreement to September 30 2017 subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Merger Agreement. The Amendment also reduces the termination fee that Alere may be required to pay Abbott under specified circumstances to $161 million from $177 million.   Completion of the Merger remains subject to various closing conditions including (1) the adoption of the Amended Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding Shares (2) there being no judgment or law enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger (3) the expiration of the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 as amended and receipt of other required antitrust approvals and (4) the absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Amended Merger Agreement). The obligation of each of Alere and Abbott to consummate the Merger is also conditioned on the other partys representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Amended Merger Agreement.   The Amendment also provides that neither any matter set forth in Aleres public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) between January 1 2014 and April 13 2017 nor any matter of which Abbott or any of Abbotts representatives was made aware prior to April 13 2017 could be taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur. Further in addition to the qualifications set forth in the Original Merger Agreement the Amendment qualifies all of Aleres representations and warranties made in the Amended Merger Agreement (including those made in the Original Merger Agreement) by all matters set forth in Aleres public filings made with the SEC between January 1 2014 and April 13 2017 and any matter known by Abbott or any of Abbotts representatives prior to April 13 2017.   In addition the Amendment changes Abbotts commitment to provide Aleres employees that continue with Abbott with specified levels of compensation and benefits to be a commitment through the first anniversary of the Effective Time rather than through December 31 2017 and a 2018 long-term incentive award to each continuing employee employed by Abbott or its subsidiaries at the time annual long-term awards are made generally that is no less favorable than the long-term incentive award made to similarly situated employees of Abbott generally.   Other than as expressly modified pursuant to the Amendment the Original Merger Agreement which was previously filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC by Abbott on February 2 2016 remains in full force and effect.  The foregoing description of the Amendment is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.   2        Item 8.01. Other Events.   Concurrently with the execution of the Amendment Abbott and Alere entered into a Settlement Agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ). The Settlement Agreement releases claims arising out of or related to the Merger and resolves the parties pending litigation in Delaware Chancery Court.  The Settlement Agreement provides reciprocal releases except for any potential antitrust claims by Alere to the extent they relate to developments after August 25 2016 which would not be released until the parties obtain all consents and regulatory clearances necessary for closing. Abbotts potential claims based on information not excluded from the definition of Material Adverse Effect in the Amended Merger Agreement are also not released.  Finally the Settlement Agreement provides for dismissal of the Delaware litigation with prejudice with the exception of the non-released antitrust claims which will be dismissed without prejudice.   On April 14 2017 Abbott and Alere issued a joint press release announcing that they had entered into the Amendment.  A copy of the joint press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.   Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results.  In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others net earnings from continuing operations excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such expenses primarily associated with acquisitions including bridge facility fees and other debt-related costs charges related to cost reduction initiatives and other expenses adjustments to tax expense as a result of the resolution of various tax positions from prior years foreign exchange loss related to Venezuela expenses related to an adjustment of Abbotts equity investment in Mylan N.V. a gain on the sale of a portion of Abbotts position in Mylan stock a decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration related to a business acquisition and recognition of deferred taxes associated with the pending disposition of AMO.  These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Some of the lenders under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) and the Bridge Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) and/or their respective affiliates have in the past performed and may in the future from time to time perform investment banking financial advisory lending and/or commercial banking services or other services for Abbott Laboratories ( Abbott ) and its subsidiaries for which they have received and may in the future receive customary compensation and expense reimbursement.   Item 2.01.  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.   On January 4 2017 Abbott completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical Inc. ( St. Jude Medical ) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 27 2016 (the  Merger Agreement ) by and among Abbott St. Jude Medical Vault Merger Sub Inc. and Vault Merger Sub LLC. Abbott completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical through two mergers: (1) first Vault Merger Sub Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott was merged with and into St. Jude Medical with St. Jude Medical surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott (the  First Merger ) and (2) second and promptly after the First Merger St. Jude Medical was merged with and into Vault Merger Sub LLC with Vault Merger Sub LLC surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott and being renamed St. Jude Medical LLC ( SJM LLC ) (the  Second Merger  and together with the First Merger the  Mergers ).   In the First Merger each share of St. Jude Medical common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the first effective time was automatically converted into the right to receive 0.8708 of an Abbott common share and $46.75 in cash without interest (the  Per Share Merger Consideration ) with any fractional Abbott common shares to be settled in cash.   In connection with completion of the First Merger vested options to purchase shares of St. Jude Medical common stock were deemed exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise and the net number of shares of St. Jude Medical common stock payable in respect thereto were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration less applicable withholding taxes with any fractional Abbott common shares to be settled in cash. In addition unvested options and restricted stock units in respect of St. Jude Medical common stock were assumed by Abbott and converted into Abbott options and restricted stock units (as applicable) of substantially equivalent value in each case in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.   Based on the closing price of $39.36 for an Abbott common share on the New York Stock Exchange on January 4 2017 the aggregate implied value of the consideration paid in connection with the Mergers was approximately $23.6 billion including approximately $10 billion in Abbott common shares and approximately $13.6 billion in cash.   After giving effect to the issuance of Abbott common shares in connection with the Mergers Abbott has approximately 1726.2 million common shares outstanding.   The foregoing description of the Mergers and the Merger Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.   Item 2.03.  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.   On January 4 2017 Abbott fully guaranteed the obligations of SJM LLC under that certain Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement dated as of January 4 2017 (as further amended restated extended supplemented or otherwise modified in writing from time to time the  Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement ) among SJM LLC the guarantors from time to time party thereto the lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America N.A. as administrative agent with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of approximately $2.3 billion substantially on the terms set forth in the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement.   The borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement will bear interest at SJM LLCs option based on either a base rate or a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on Abbotts credit ratings. The Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants customary for   2        unsecured financings of this type as well as customary events of default.  A copy of the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement will be filed with a future periodic report.   Also on January 4 2017 in connection with the Mergers Abbott borrowed $2.0 billion under that certain 120-Day Bridge Term Loan Agreement (as amended restated extended supplemented or otherwise modified in writing from time to time the  Bridge Term Loan Agreement ) dated as of December 13 2016 by and among Abbott the lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America N.A. as administrative agent.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results.  In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others net earnings from continuing operations excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as the foreign exchange loss related to Venezuela; cost reduction initiatives; transaction-related costs; and resolution of various tax positions and adjustment of tax uncertainties from prior years.  These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results.  In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others net earnings from continuing operations excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as cost reduction initiatives; transaction-related costs; tax expense associated with a one-time repatriation of ex-U.S. earnings; resolution of various tax positions and adjustment of tax uncertainties from prior years; gain on the sale of a portion of Abbotts position in Mylan stock; and a decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration related to a business acquisition.  These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results.  In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others net earnings excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as cost reduction initiatives; transaction-related costs; tax expense associated with a one-time repatriation of ex-U.S. earnings; gain on the sale of a portion of Abbotts position in Mylan stock; and a decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration related to a business acquisition.  These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results.  In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others net earnings excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as cost reduction initiatives; integration and separation-related costs; transaction-related costs; a philanthropic contribution to the Abbott Fund; benefits of U.S. tax law changes; tax expense associated with a one-time repatriation of ex-U.S. earnings; and tax expense adjustments for resolution of various tax positions and tax uncertainties from prior years.  These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In November 2014 Abbott entered into an agreement to sell its animal health business to Zoetis. As a result of the planned disposition of these businesses the results of these businesses are being reported as discontinued operations.   Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 is Abbotts unaudited non-GAAP financial information for the first three quarters of 2014 reflecting the presentation of the developed markets branded generics pharmaceutical business and the animal health business as discontinued operations and other adjustments to provide a historical baseline of Abbotts standalone operating results from continuing operations and excluding specified items. Abbott plans to evaluate its future results from continuing operations against this historical baseline.  Exhibit 99.1 also provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP information to Abbotts historical consolidated results in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others net earnings excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as cost reduction initiatives; integration and separation-related costs; transaction-related costs; a philanthropic contribution to the Abbott Fund; benefits of U.S. tax law changes; tax expense associated with a one-time repatriation of ex-U.S. earnings; and tax expense adjustments for resolution of various tax positions from previous years.  These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.   The financial information is intended for informational purposes only and does not purport to project Abbotts financial performance or cost structure for any future period. The financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in Abbotts Form 10K for the year ended December 31 2013.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results.  In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others net earnings excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as cost reduction initiatives; benefits of U.S. tax law changes; tax expense associated with a one-time repatriation of ex-U.S. earnings; and tax expense adjustments for resolution of various tax positions from previous years.  These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The BTA provides for the acquisition by Mylan of Abbotts non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business (the  Assets ) in an all-stock transaction.  In the transaction Abbott will transfer the Assets to New Mylan in consideration for 105000000 New Mylan ordinary shares (the  Business Transfer ) and immediately following the transfer Merger Sub will merge with and into Mylan with Mylan surviving the merger and continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mylan (the  Merger  and together with the Business Transfer collectively the  Transaction ). At the effective time of the Merger each issued and outstanding share of Mylan common stock will be converted into the right to receive one New Mylan ordinary share.   Prior to closing the Transaction New Mylan will be converted into a public limited company (naamloze vennootschap) and will be renamed  Mylan N.V. .  New Mylan is organized in the Netherlands.  Mylan has advised Abbott that New Mylan will be led by Mylans current leadership team and board of directors.  New Mylans ordinary shares are expected to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Following completion of the Transaction the former shareholders of Mylan will own approximately 79% of the outstanding New Mylan ordinary shares and Abbott will indirectly own approximately 21% of the outstanding New Mylan ordinary shares.   The Transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both Abbott and Mylan.   The parties have made customary representations and warranties in the BTA and have agreed to customary pre-closing and post-closing covenants. In addition the BTA provides that the parties will indemnify each other for breaches of these representations and warranties subject to certain limitations and for certain other matters.   Under the BTA Abbott will agree for a period of two-years to certain non-competition restrictions in the non-U.S. developed markets with respect to pharmaceutical products which contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as the acquired products subject to certain exceptions.   The consummation of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the approval of the Merger by Mylans shareholders. Abbott will not require shareholder approval in connection with the Transaction.   The BTA contains certain customary termination rights including the right of either party to terminate the agreement if the Transaction is not completed by October 13 2015 subject to extension for a period of 90 days in the event conditions relating to regulatory approvals have not been satisfied as of that date.  Neither party has the right to terminate the BTA in order to engage in an alternative transaction. If the BTA is terminated in certain circumstances including in the event that certain regulatory approvals are not obtained approval of Mylans shareholders is not obtained or Mylans board of directors withdraws its recommendation of the Transaction or approves or recommends an alternative acquisition proposal for Mylan Mylan will be required at Abbotts option to reimburse Abbotts costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction (including certain restructuring related taxes) provided that Mylan will not be required to reimburse Abbott for an amount in excess of $100000000.   2        Upon as of the consummation of the Transaction New Mylan Abbott will enter into a Shareholder Agreement. The Shareholder Agreement will impose certain restrictions on Abbott including prohibiting transfers of New Moon ordinary shares to competitors of Mylan and to activist investors as defined in the agreement as well as to customary standstill limitations so long as Abbotts ownership interest in New Moon equals or exceeds 5%.  Abbott will agree to vote its New Moon ordinary shares subject to certain exceptions relating to significant corporate transactions in accordance with the recommendation by New Moons board of directors.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results.  In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others net earnings excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as cost reduction initiatives and other restructuring actions; benefits of U.S. tax law changes; tax expense associated with a one-time repatriation of ex-U.S. earnings; and tax expense adjustments for resolution of various tax positions from previous years.  These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Changes in Registrants Certifying Accountant.   (a)   Dismissal of Independent Registered Public Accountant   As previously reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 14 2012 the Audit Committee (the  Audit Committee ) of the Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories (the  Company ) approved the dismissal of Deloitte & Touche LLP ( Deloitte ) as the Companys independent registered public accountant effective as of the date of Deloittes completion of the audit services for the fiscal year ended December 31 2013 and the filing of the Companys 2013 Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K.  On February 21 2014 the Company filed its 2013 Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K.   The reports of Deloitte on the Companys consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31 2012 and 2013 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty audit scope or accounting principle.  The 2013 and 2012 reports included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Companys distribution of the shares of AbbVie Inc. to the Companys shareholders on January 1 2013 and the Companys change to the year end of its foreign subsidiaries during 2011.   During the Companys fiscal years ended December 31 2012 and 2013 and through February 21 2014 the date on which the Company filed its 2013 Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K (i) there were no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the Company and Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or practices financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte would have caused Deloitte to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports on the Companys consolidated financial statements for such years and (ii) there were no  reportable events  (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).   The Company has provided Deloitte with a copy of this Form 8-K/A and requested that Deloitte provide the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not Deloitte agrees with the above disclosures.  A copy of Deloittes letter dated February 21 2014 is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K/A.   (b)  Newly Appointed Independent Registered Public Accountant   As previously reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 14 2012 the Audit Committee approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm to perform independent audit services beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31 2014.   During the Companys fiscal years ended December 31 2012 and 2013 and through February 21 2014 neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted Ernst & Young regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the consolidated financial statements of the Company in any case where a written report or oral advice was provided to the Company by Ernst   2        & Young that Ernst & Young concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a  reportable event  (as the term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as cost reduction initiatives philanthropic contributions costs that transferred or will be charged to AbbVie Inc. as part of the separation of Abbotts research-based pharmaceuticals business an interest expense adjustment to reflect Abbotts capital structure after the separation of AbbVie Inc. tax expense adjustments for resolution of various tax positions from previous years and separation-related and integration costs.

( AbbVie ) a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories ( Abbott ) entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee (the  Trustee ) (as supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No.1 dated November 8 2012 (the  Supplemental Indenture ) the  Indenture ) relating to the issuance by AbbVie of $3500000000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.200% senior notes due 2015 (the  Fixed 2015 Notes ) $4000000000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.750% senior notes due 2017 (the  2017 Notes ) $1000000000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.000% senior notes due 2018 (the  2018 Notes ) $3100000000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.900% senior notes due 2022 (the  2022 Notes ) $2600000000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.400% senior notes due 2042 (the  2042 Notes  and together with the Fixed 2015 Notes the 2017 Notes the 2018 Notes and the 2022 Notes the  Fixed Rate Notes ) and $500000000 aggregate principal amount of its floating rate senior notes due 2015 (the  Floating 2015 Notes ). The Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating 2015 Notes are collectively hereinafter referred to as the  Notes  and each of the Fixed 2015 Notes the 2017 Notes the 2018 Notes the 2022 Notes the 2042 Notes and the Floating 2015 Notes are hereinafter referred to as a  series  of Notes.   The Notes except for $3037486000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes (the  Exchanged Notes ) were issued and sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the  Securities Act ) and non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act (the  Private Placement ). The Exchanged Notes were issued by AbbVie to Abbott as partial consideration for the transfer to AbbVie of assets (including interests in intangible assets and stock of subsidiaries) used in connection with the proprietary pharmaceutical business of Abbott and its subsidiaries. Abbott then exchanged the Exchanged Notes with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ( Morgan Stanley ) in satisfaction and discharge of commercial paper that was previously issued by Abbott to Morgan Stanley. The Exchanged Notes were sold by Morgan Stanley in the Private Placement.   Abbott has guaranteed each series of Notes on an unsecured unsubordinated basis pursuant to a Guarantee dated as of November 8 2012 in favor of the Trustee for the holders of the Notes (the  Guarantee ). The Guarantee will terminate upon the previously announced distribution by Abbott of shares of AbbVie common stock to shareholders of Abbott.   AbbVie intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes (other than the Exchanged Notes) to make a cash distribution to Abbott to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. Abbott intends to use the proceeds it receives from AbbVie in part to fund its previously announced cash tender offers for certain of Abbotts outstanding notes.   AbbVie may redeem all of the Notes of each series other than the Floating 2015 Notes at any time and some of the Notes of each series other than the Floating 2015 Notes from time to time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may not redeem the Floating 2015 Notes prior to maturity.   2        Subject to certain qualifications and exceptions the Indenture limits AbbVies ability and the ability of AbbVies subsidiaries to create or permit to exist mortgages with respect to principal domestic properties and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal domestic properties and limits AbbVies ability to merge or consolidate with any other entity or convey transfer or lease AbbVies properties and assets substantially as an entirety.   The Indenture also provides for certain events of default (subject in certain cases to receipt of notice of default and/or customary grace or cure periods) including but not limited to (i) failure to pay interest for 30 days (ii) failure to pay principal when due (iii) failure to perform or breach of any other covenant in the Indenture for 90 days after notice is given by the trustee or the holders of 25% of the outstanding principal amount and (iv) certain specified events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization of AbbVie.   Purchase Agreement   The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to a Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) dated as of November 5 2012 by and among AbbVie Abbott as Guarantor Morgan Stanley as Selling Noteholder and Morgan Stanley Barclays Capital Inc. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith Incorporated and the other several purchasers named in Schedule I thereto as Initial Purchasers (the  Initial Purchasers ).   Registration Rights Agreement   On November 8 2012 AbbVie Abbott and the Initial Purchasers entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the Notes (the  Registration Rights Agreement ). AbbVie and Abbott agreed under the Registration Rights Agreement to (i) file a registration statement on an appropriate registration form with respect to a registered offer to exchange the Notes for new notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes and (ii) cause the registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act.   If the exchange offer is not completed on or before November 4 2013 AbbVie will use its reasonable best efforts to file and to have declared effective a shelf registration statement relating to the resales of the Notes.   If AbbVie fails to satisfy this obligation (a  registration default ) under the Registration Rights Agreement the annual interest rate on the Notes will increase by 0.25%. The annual interest rate on the Notes will increase by an additional 0.25% for each subsequent 90-day period during which the registration default continues up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.00% per year. If the registration default is corrected the applicable interest rate on the Notes will revert to the original level.   If AbbVie must pay additional interest AbbVie will pay it to the holders of the Notes in cash on the same dates that it makes other interest payments on the Notes until the registration default is corrected.   The preceding is a summary of the terms of the Indenture the Supplemental Indenture the Guarantee and the Registration Rights Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this report the Supplemental Indenture filed as Exhibit 4.2 to this report the Guarantee filed as Exhibit 4.3 to this report and the Registration Rights   3        Agreement filed as Exhibit 4.4 to this report each of which is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein.

The discontinuation is based on a recommendation from the studys Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) regarding safety concerns due to  excess serious adverse events and mortality in the bardoxolone methyl arm.   Regulatory Agencies have been notified of this decision and study sites and study participants are currently being informed.   Reata and Abbott will closely examine the data from this study to determine whether there is an appropriate path forward for the development of bardoxolone methyl in chronic kidney disease or other indications.   Abbott has the rights to bardoxolone methyl outside the U.S. excluding certain Asian markets.    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements   Some statements in this Form 8-K may be forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results.  In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as acquisition-related costs separation costs a milestone payment litigation reserves acquired in-process research and development restructuring and cost reduction initiatives and the effect of the change in the calendar year-end for international operations.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results.  In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as acquisition-related costs asset impairments currency devaluations legislative reforms product recalls and withdrawals litigation reserves acquired in-process research and development tax audit settlements restructuring and cost reduction initiatives and the effect of the change in the calendar year-end for international operations.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In addition the Amended By-laws provide that any rights that an individual has for indemnification from the Company pursuant to the Companys Articles of Incorporation are also enforceable under the Amended By-laws and are contractual rights which vest at the commencement of such persons service to or at the request of the Company and that any modification of the Articles of Incorporation the Illinois Business Corporation Act or any other applicable law that diminishes or adversely affects such rights shall not apply retrospectively.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results.  In that news release Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as acquisition-related costs asset impairments currency devaluations legislative reforms product recalls and withdrawals litigation reserves acquired in-process research and development tax audit settlements restructuring and cost reduction initiatives and the effect of the change in the calendar year-end for international operations.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable such as acquisition-related costs currency devaluations legislative reforms litigation settlements acquired in-process research and development cost reduction initiatives asset impairments product recalls and withdrawals and product launch costs.  Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.  Abbott however cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

This plan streamlines operations improves efficiencies and reduces costs in certain Solvay sites and functions as well as in certain Abbott and Solvay commercial organizations in various countries. Action plans have been identified and most are expected to be implemented within the next two years. The majority of the savings are targeted to be realized by 2012. This plan is expected to result in annual savings that have been contemplated in Abbotts ongoing earnings-per-share accretion forecast for the Solvay acquisition as communicated when the acquisition was announced in September 2009.   These actions will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $810 to $970 million over the next 2 years.  These charges include employee-related costs of approximately $650 million accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs of approximately $105 million and other related exit costs of up to $215 million related to the discontinuation of certain R&D programs and the transfer of certain product manufacturing/R&D to other Abbott facilities.  Non-cash charges included in the total will be approximately $105 million reflecting the accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs noted above.  The employee-related costs and other related exit costs will require the outlay of cash.   Approximately $475 to $640 million of the charges are forecast to occur in the second half of 2010 with roughly $430 million projected in the third quarter. Abbott expects to treat these costs as specified items and as a result these costs will not impact Abbotts ongoing earnings-per-share guidance in 2010.   Item 8.01               Other Events   In addition to the restructuring costs associated with streamlining operations and reducing costs Abbott has completed its integration planning for the Solvay Pharmaceuticals acquisition and expects to incur one-time costs of approximately $135 million in the second half of 2010 and $175 million in 2011 related to integrating Abbott and Solvay Pharmaceutical operations including information technology support services R&D and commercial operations. Abbott expects to treat these costs as specified items and as a result these costs will not impact Abbotts ongoing earnings-per-share guidance in 2010.   Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements   Some statements in this Form 8-K may be forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
